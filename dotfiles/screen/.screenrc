# The simplest ~/.screenrc  can have just a half-dozen lines like:

shell -${SHELL}
caption always "%n(%t) : %C"
defscrollback 30000
startup_message off
hardstatus on
hardstatus alwayslastline "%{rk}%H %{yk}%M%d %{wk}%?%-Lw%?%{bw}%n*%f %t%?(%u)%?%{wk}%?%+Lw%?"
logfile $HOME/var/log/screen/%Y%m%d-%n.log
deflog on
altscreen on

# After that basic set-up the simplest way to enhance your ~/.screenrc is to add bind commands, for example

bind ' ' windowlist -b 

# This screenrc  command would bind the space key to the command that displays a list of windows (so that the command usually invoked by C-a " would also be available as C-a space which is much more convenient),
# 
# shell -${SHELL} 
# caption always "%n(%t) : %C"
# 
# Another useful step is to make more user-friendly caption. A better variant of caption would be

caption always "%3n %t%? @%u%?%? [%h]%?%=%c"

# Slightly more complex would be:
# 
# caption always "%{= kc}%H (system load: %l)%-21=%{= .m}%D %d.%m.%Y %0c"
# 
# The value of title can be changed by command:
# 
# C-a A
# 
# You can specify in your screenrc  file arbitrary number of initial screens, for example
# 
# screen bash
# title "this is my first screen"
# screen bash
# title " this is a screen reserved for editor"
# 
# You can combine the  command title with the command screen in one line using -t  key in screen command:
# 
# screen -ln -t "root shell" -h 1000 9 su
# 
# This command creates a window with title `root shell' in slot #9, with a superuser shell and a scrollback buffer of 1000 lines.
# 
# Autoindent mode in vi.
# 
# #register [ "\033:se noai\015a"
# ##register ] "\033:se ai\015a"
# ##bind ^] paste [.]
