# ~/.profile
#
# This file is executed for login shells. It will not be executed by
# bash if either ~/.bash_profile or ~/.bash_login exists.
#
# See /usr/share/doc/bash/examples/startup-files for examples.

# NOTE: I removed code from here and put everything in .bashrc; for now at
# least I work exclusively in Bash, so shell-generic login-shell configuration
# is not needed

# the default umask is set in /etc/profile; for setting the umask
# for ssh logins, install and configure the libpam-umask package.
#umask 022
